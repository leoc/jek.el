** Usage

*** jekel/create-project

This will create a dummy project with the least amount of files
necessary to run jekel.

*** jekel/create-page

This will create a new page. Emacs will ask for the file name of the
new page.

*** jekel/create-post

This will create a new post inside the `_posts` directory. Emacs will
ask for a title of the new post and create a new post with the current
date.

*** jekel/publish

When the current buffer shows an org file, then it will go up the
directory structure and look for a `config.el` file, which contains
the jek.el project configuration.

When itÂ´s found, it gets loaded and the project will be published.
Otherwise you will be asked for a project to publish. It is actually a
wrapper for org-modes `org-publish-project`.
