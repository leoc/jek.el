This is a blog post. Just an example. Jek.el is going to be a static
website generator with a built-in blogging feature. Just like its Ruby
cousin Jekyll.

* A Jek.el project

A typical jek.el project has a configuration file that defines the
projects meta information, a layouts folder that contains the layouts
that may be used by each page, a posts directory that contains the
blog posts.

To create a generic jek.el project, simply do "M-x jekel-create-project".

** Jek.el Configuration

The jek.el configuration is done via org-modes publish
configuration.

#+name: config.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

** Jek.el Layouts

Jek.els layouts are written with markup.el, which is a emacs-lisp
markup generation library. You do not have to fiddle with html
directly. Simply write your markup code in lisp.

ThatÂ´s not only cleaner but also provides the feature of calling
helper functions inside your markup declaration.

#+name: default.html.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

** Jek.el As Static Weblog Generator

Each blog post is an org-file inside the "_posts" directory (That
directory may be altered in your projects configuration).
